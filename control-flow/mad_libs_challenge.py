"""

Create a Python program that generates a Mad Libs story using conditional statements. Here’s what your program should achieve:

Prompt the user: Ask the user for different words following specific prompts, such as a noun, verb, adjective, etc.
Store the user’s input: Use input() to capture the user’s words and store them in variables.
Build the story: Construct a story template with placeholders for the user-provided words.
Conditional Touches (Bonus): Use conditional statements (if, else) to add some variation to the story based on the user’s input.
Display the final story:Print the complete Mad Libs story with the user’s inserted words.
On a beautiful (adjective) day, I went to the zoo. I saw a funny (adjective) monkey swinging from the trees. Then, I spotted a majestic (adjective) lion lounging in the sun.  What a wild and (adjective) experience! 
Tips:
Use descriptive variable names to improve code readability.
Consider adding more prompts and placeholders for a richer story.
Feel free to experiment with different story themes and conditional variations.
